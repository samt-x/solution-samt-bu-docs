This section documents the technical solutions used to build and operate the SAMT-BU documentation platform. The content is aimed at future developers, architects, and administrators who need to understand, maintain, or further develop the solution.

The platform is composed of the following components:

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **Hugo** | Static site generator – builds HTML from Markdown |
| **Decap CMS** | Browser-based content editing for non-technical users |
| **Hugo Modules** | Content modules from separate repositories are mounted into the site |
| **GitHub Actions** | CI/CD pipeline – builds and deploys on push to `main` |
| **Cloudflare Workers** | OAuth proxy for secure CMS authentication against GitHub |
| **GitHub Pages** | Hosting of the finished website |

See the sub-chapters for technical documentation and administration guides.
