## 2026-03-02: Search not working (jQuery defer conflict)

**Symptom:** Search field accepted input but returned no results.

**Root cause:** jQuery loaded with `defer` in `header.html`, but `search.js`, `lunr.min.js`, and `horsey.js` were loaded synchronously. `search.js` ran before `$` (jQuery) was available → `$.getJSON()` threw an error → `lunrIndex` remained `null` → silent failure.

**Fix:** Added `defer` to all three search scripts in `layouts/partials/search.html`.

**Lesson:** When one script has `defer`, all scripts depending on it must also have `defer`.
